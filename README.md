# The Broducer's Theme

### A rather opinionated Hugo theme tailored for music producers.

#### The main objective is to provide a straightforward, almost-single-file configuration, where you can define all your data and have your page ready in a matter of minutes.

#### You can check the [live demo here](https://luca-mancini.gitlab.io/theme-broducer/)!

Hello fellow producer, and thanks for stopping by!

While we're busy writing instructions for the theme usage, feel free to explore it yourself, it should be quite self-explanatory.

The main things to know:
1. The main configuration options are located in **/hugo.toml**
2. You can add/modify your services by using markdown files in **/themes/theme-broducer/content/services/**
3. You can add/modify the releases by using markdown files in **/themes/theme-broducer/content/portfolio/**. There's no need to delete older releases - the theme will automatically pull the latest ones (ordered by release date, descending), according to the max number set in **/hugo.toml**

Would you face any problem, feel free to open a [GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/luca-mancini/theme-broducer/-/issues/new).

##### The Broducer's Theme is made by [Luca Mancini](https://www.lucamancini.com) and [Georgi Zhelyazkov](https://sinistersoundworks.com), and it is inspired by the [Agency Jekyll theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme)
